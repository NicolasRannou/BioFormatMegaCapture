metadataConversion.sh converts metadata from an input image file to a MegaCapture (.meg) metadata format.

The command has three (3) required inputs in specific order:

1) metadata file (e.g. log.txt)
2) name of the .meg output file you want without the extension (e.g. datetest)
3) the extension of the input image data that defines the format of the input metadata file (e.g. zvi)
